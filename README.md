# Open_RSI_Seg_CD
## Introduction

This work explores how we can segment remote-sensing images in the open world. The implementation is based on the Google Bard and Segment Anything Model (SAM).

## Installation SAM

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```
Then the model can be used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt:

```
from segment_anything import SamPredictor, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from segment_anything import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```
