# Open_RSI_Seg_CD
## Introduction

This work explores how we can segment remote-sensing images in the open world. The implementation is based on the Google Bard and Segment Anything Model (SAM).

### Install SAM

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```
Then the model can be used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt:

```
from segment_anything import SamPredictor, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from segment_anything import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```

### Install Bard
```
$ pip install bardapi
```
```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API.git
```
### Authentication
> **Warning** Do not expose the `__Secure-1PSID` 
1. Visit https://bard.google.com/
2. F12 for console
3. Session: Application → Cookies → Copy the value of  `__Secure-1PSID` cookie.

Note that while I referred to `__Secure-1PSID` value as an API key for convenience, it is not an officially provided API key. 
Cookie value subject to frequent changes. Verify the value again if an error occurs. Most errors occur when an invalid cookie value is entered.

<br>

If you need to set multiple Cookie values

- [Bard Cookies](https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API/blob/main/README_DEV.md#bard-which-can-get-cookies) - After confirming that multiple cookie values are required to receive responses reliably in certain countries, I will deploy it for testing purposes. Please debug and create a pull request

### Usage 
To get response dictionary
```python
import bardapi
import os

# set your __Secure-1PSID value to key
token = 'xxxxxxx'

# set your input text
input_text = "나와 내 동년배들이 좋아하는 뉴진스에 대해서 알려줘"

# Send an API request and get a response.
response = bardapi.core.Bard(token).get_answer(input_text)
```
#### Bard `ask_about_image` method 
*It may not work as it is only available for certain accounts, regions, and other restrictions.*
As an experimental feature, it is possible to ask questions with an image. However, this functionality is only available for accounts with image upload capability in Bard's web UI. 

```python
from bardapi import Bard

bard = Bard(token='xxxxxxx')
image = open('image.jpg', 'rb').read() # (jpeg, png, webp) are supported.
bard_answer = bard.ask_about_image('What is in the image?', image)
```
